# Style Presets — Quick Reference Index

Presets are **shortcuts into the 6-Element Framework** — not a separate system. Each preset pre-fills all 6 framework elements with tested configurations. You can use a preset as-is or as a starting point and override individual elements.

For the full framework: see `visual-framework.md`

## Using Presets with the Framework

1. **Identify the preset** from user keywords or explicit request
2. **Load the style file** (`references/style-{name}.md`) for full detail
3. **Start with preset element values** in the Visual Breakdown
4. **Override elements** based on the user's specific request
5. **Adjust model recommendation** if user has a preference or only one backend is available

Presets save time but never restrict creativity. Any element can be overridden.
