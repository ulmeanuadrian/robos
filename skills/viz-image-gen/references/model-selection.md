# Model Selection Guide

Choose the right backend based on the task. If both API keys are available, auto-select using this matrix. If only one key is set, use that backend.

## Decision Matrix

| Task Type | Best Backend | Confidence | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Text-heavy designs** (posters, signage, infographics with labels) | GPT | High | 95%+ text accuracy vs ~60-70% on Gemini |
| **UI mockups & wireframes** | GPT | High | Understands UI vocabulary, coherent layouts, readable labels |
| **Brand-consistent batch assets** | GPT | High | Higher multi-run consistency |
| **Transparent backgrounds** | GPT | High | Native transparency support (Gemini doesn't support it) |
| **Technical diagrams with labels** | GPT | Medium | Better text rendering, but both handle structure well |
| **Atmospheric/environmental scenes** | Gemini | High | Stronger dramatic lighting, depth, natural atmospherics |
| **Lifestyle photography** | Gemini | High | More expressive, natural feel, less "cleaned up" |
| **Rapid iteration / exploration** | Gemini | Medium | Faster generation (5-10s vs 8-15s) |
| **Image editing / refinement** | Gemini | Medium | Conversational inpainting — modify areas without regenerating |
| **Character consistency across images** | Gemini | Medium | Built-in reference image support (up to 14 images) |
| **Budget-sensitive batch work** | Gemini | Medium | Generally cheaper per image via API |
| **Product photography (precision)** | GPT | Medium | Accurate representation, readable packaging labels |
| **Product photography (lifestyle)** | Gemini | Medium | Better atmospheric/lifestyle aesthetics |
| **Creative/artistic exploration** | Either | Low | GPT is consistent, Gemini is more variable/expressive |
| **Comic strips / storyboards** | Either | Low | Both handle well with the right prompt template |

## Quick Decision

Ask these questions in order:

1. **Does the image need readable text?** → GPT
2. **Does it need a transparent background?** → GPT
3. **Is it a UI/wireframe mockup?** → GPT
4. **Is it an atmospheric/environmental scene?** → Gemini
5. **Is it lifestyle or editorial photography?** → Gemini
6. **Is speed the priority?** → Gemini
7. **None of the above?** → Default to GPT (higher consistency)

## Model Strengths by Style (Shootout Evidence)

Based on direct comparison testing across 9 visual categories:

### GPT Wins (5/9 tests)

| Style | Why GPT Wins | Evidence |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Hyperreal Portrait** | Organic hair rendering, deep eye detail, engraved armor patterns | Individual hair strands with natural light interaction, iris striations, armor engravings following consistent logic |
| **Macro Close-Up** | Forensic detail without AI smoothing | Visible iris collagen fibers, individual lash roots, proper corneal catchlight, skin pores with depth |
| **Text / Typography** | 6/6 element accuracy, superior design hierarchy | 95%+ text accuracy, natural typographic spacing, multi-word rendering |
| **Technical Annotation** | Reliable text labels, two-layer visual separation | Clean base diagrams with accurate labels + distinct annotation layer |
| **Notebook Sketch** | Text label accuracy for sketchnotes (slight edge) | Readable bullet points and headers, controlled layout |

### Gemini Wins (2/9 tests)

| Style | Why Gemini Wins | Evidence |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Cinematic** | Artifact-free atmospheric scenes, natural neon reflections | Clean volumetric fog, proper color bleeding on wet surfaces, no wavy line artifacts |
| **Anime / Illustration** | Clean cel-shaded output, no rendering artifacts in flat color | Consistent quality across anime sub-styles, no ripple artifacts in flat areas |

### True Ties (2/9 tests)

| Style | Context | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **UGC / Influencer** | GPT for product labels, Gemini for candid authenticity | GPT: legible packaging text. Gemini: raw, imperfect energy that feels real |
| **Product / Luxury** | GPT for catalog precision, Gemini for editorial mood | GPT: accurate material physics. Gemini: superior wet surfaces and dramatic shadows |

### Key Artifact Note

GPT's compositional superiority is sometimes undermined by **wavy line artifacts** — particularly visible in:
- Volumetric fog/haze areas
- Flat color cel-shaded regions
- Atmospheric/smoke effects

When atmosphere or flat color purity is critical, Gemini is the safer choice regardless of GPT's compositional advantage.
